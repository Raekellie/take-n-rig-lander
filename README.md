# Take N RiG Lander
A veeerryyyy old game prototype I made, timestamped to 2017-08-14! Made in Unity.
It consists of a little rocket whose three thrusters you control individually, left, middle (main) and right, allowing
to fly more quickly by engaging all three, middle+side for quick turning, or just one side for slower pitching.

Hitting walls destroys the ship, except if it's the bottom part touching (which might still trigger an explosion if
the ship is going too fast).
All of the rocket's art was made by me in Inkscape. Unfortunately I've since lost the original SVGs.

I never got around to adding obstacles, besides the walls around the screen, but the objective was to make obstacle
courses the player has to go through without crashing, and carefully land at the end.

**There is a video**, extremely old and low quality, but I had it recorded and uploaded to YT back then!... Which I
quickly unlisted out of shame... But today I decided to show and safeguard my old archives, so here it is, all of it!

## Video
It's in the root of the repository, `gameplay.mp4`
Picture below, which links to the video itself. I couldn't figure out GitHub embeds :p
